# Why is a text editor important?

A text editor ultimatelely allows us to create code in a more efficient manor. This is greatly important because as we all know, time is the most important asset we all possess. a text editor is the most important part of being a web developer/software engineer because it is the basis in which everything is created. It is like the canvas to the painter or the paper for the author. It is the base for the art to take place. 


# What is a text editor?

"A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
What features should you look for in a text editor? I would say some of the most important features are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them."[^1]

# What are the the different classifications of text editors?

The three classifications of text editors are "basic text editors", "coding specific text editors", and "IDE" (Integrated Development Environment)

Basic text editors are fairly self explanatory; they are used to edit text and have a barebones suite of editing options. They are the simplest tools. An example for Macs would be the TextEdit application that comes pre-installed on the system. It does not contain error solutions or text completion for example. These programs can be used for creating code but ultimately provide little assistance to the end user. 

Coding specific text editors are text editors designed solely for the use of designing and implementing code. "Syntax highlighting, indentation, autocomplete, and brace matching functionality are some of the features that can be found in code editors. These features were developed with the express purpose of making it easier and faster to type source code." [^2]

An IDE "Integrated Development Envioronment" is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If youâ€™ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one software package."[^1]
