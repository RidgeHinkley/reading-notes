## What is a growth mindset?

What growth mindset means to me is never seeing setbacks as failure, but as learning opportunities. Always believing in my ability to become better through challenging times. 

## Three reminders to stay in a growth mindset:

1. Keep pushing forward even when discouraged or stuck
2. No negative self-talk
3. Practice, practice, practice!
