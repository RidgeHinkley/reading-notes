## **Why does learning Markdown matter?**

Learning and reading about Markdown greatly benefits our progression through this module as it is an efficient way of formatting a sophisticated looking webpage without having to do everything from scratch. 


## **Similarities between Markdown and my previous experiences**

Using Markdown syntax is similar to my previous job where we used a software program called CDK. My previous job was being a service consultant for Volkswagen. I was essentially the person you talked to when you brought your car in for service and went over any issues or pricing, etc. CDK was designed to streamline processes and provide a database of stored commands to make an easier to use platform. For example, when closing out a repair order, we would use a page called "PFC" or Post Final Charges. This page was used for notes, making sure charges were correct, and giving the technicians their correct times and ensuring the client was aware of all services performed. There were many commands such as ASL for "Add Sublet Line", DC "Display Cost" so we made sure our costs were not more than what we were charging the client. Markdown uses short key strokes and symbols that add up to big differences; much like the CDK software that takes short commands to perform large tasks. 

'Markdown is similar in a sense where there are shortcuts via the software to make everything move more quickly. One example is creating a heading that is a larger font than the subtext below it by using a simple number of "*" symbols in front of the sentence. For example, the largest heading you could add to the text would be signified by a single "#" whereas a slightly smaller version can be created by using "##" and so on and so forth. Without shortcuts and key-phrases, my job would have been much harder and taken much longer. I see the similarity with Markdown by allowing me to perform possibly complicated procedures in a much shorter and easier time.
