# Why are revisions and the cloud important?

Revisions and the cloud are very important aspects of the development of webpages and software. Without centralized and always accessible information on projects; work would be much harder to complete. This is extremely important to our module as we are learning to work with new tools outside of Github. However, these revisions need to be documented and  traced.

"The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS). This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. "[^1] 

However, the CVCS provided issues with stability. BEcause of this, the DVCS was created. "A Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions. Also, in the event of corruption of a central database’s hard disk — with the absence of backups — all work will be lost, except for any portions on local machines.

To prevent this type of catastrophic loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information. Because the DVCS allows for multiple mirrored repositories, programmers working in teams can collaborate with each other in various ways to complete a joint project, which enables the use of various simultaneous workflows."[^1]

This module reminds me of my personal experience in life. Working in teams and having the tools to do the work correctly makes everything smoother. I can see this being a huge help in the web development sector as people can work on things at different times depending on scheduling. THey can also have an active proofreading system through the use of teammates.
